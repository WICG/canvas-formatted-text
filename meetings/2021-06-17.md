### Agenda

* Meeting boilerplate (scribe, [CEPC](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/))
* Introductions
* Overview of explainer status
* Use cases review
   * Additional use cases to consider?
* Data model overview
* Data model new issues/concerns?
* Next steps


### Present
- Travis: PM @Microsoft
- noamh: Excel online, Eng @Microsoft
- Yego: Flutter, Eng @Google
- Koji: Lead for text layout @Google
- Fernando: Tech manager for canvas on Chrome
- Sayna: PM @Microsoft
- Sushanth: Eng Mgr @Microsoft
- Mike: Graphics engineer works on SKIA @Google

### Summary
Use cases:
- layout and text flow
- shaping: a more lower level solution that requires knowledge of data about glyph shapes and geometries.

Concerns about font-files:
- loading fonts is computatoinally expensive and it makes the spec more complicated
- access rights in parsing font-files can be problematic
- how to access details with glyph id without parsing font-files

Mike created another explainer for [exposing the end result of shaping](https://github.com/google/skia/blob/main/site/docs/dev/design/text_shaper.md).


### Next steps

Land the drawing API (on the dev side) and writing a draft of the measure API explainer.

[10:06] <Sayna_> scribe: Sayna_
[10:06] <Sayna_> noamh: excel online, plans on using formatted text
[10:08] <@Travis> yjbanov: works on Flutter(?) team
[10:08] <@Travis> sushanth: Microsoft, implementing the explainer
[10:09] <@Travis> koji: lead for text layout at Google
[10:09] <@Travis> fernando: tech manager for canvas on Chrome
[10:09] <Sayna_> Mike: Graphics engine at Google
[10:09] <@Travis> mike: work on SKIA at Google
[10:10] <yjbanov> Flutter, correct (flutter.dev)
[10:12] <Sayna_> @Travis: We wrote an explainer a year ago, and after feedback for Canvas Formatted text in 3 parts:
[10:12] <Sayna_> ... data mode, rendering, and text metrics.
[10:13] <Sayna_> ... Many applications on the web starting to use canvas, we need to handle multi line text and formatted text.
[10:14] <Sayna_> Fernando: Let's talk about the use case. For some of the applications that we have, we have a low level use case that doesn't care about layout.
[10:15] <Sayna_> ... may be a performance implication when you care about shaping and when you want to put the text whereever you want and you dont' care about layout engine being exposed?
[10:17] <Sayna_> Travis: repeating the question - there is an additional, more low level use case where we don't care how the text will flow, but care more about how the text glyphs/shape/geometry
[10:19] <Sayna_> yjbanov: generate data for rendering directly and skipping the first two stages of rendering.
[10:20] <Sayna_> Fernando: these two cases can come together - It would be good to take both use cases into account.
[10:21] <Sayna_> ... glyphID isn't the issue, but unsure
[10:22] <Sayna_> ... advanced position is a metric that peeps might care about.
[10:24] <Sayna_> Sushanth: layout vs pure shaping: we did initial prototype with SKIA, we ran into issues like
[10:24] <Sayna_> ... format ranges of text and render with SKIA, it would have problems with boundaries of text
[10:26] <Sayna_> mike: Formatted text is a complete-looking spec from input to markup with many fields - perhaps still incomplete - we have a parallel looking set of explainers similar to what we have here. We have a simpler idea of marking up a rich paragraph, we propose explicitly exposing the result of the shaping.
[10:27] <Sayna_> ... (?), we expose result of concrete runs, and the concrete glyph IDs, allow people to take output and render to canvas 2D
[10:28] <Sayna_> ... with the exposed data, they can do hit testing. It is the data that is important. You captured kernings, and more.
[10:29] <Sayna_> ... ask: while you have a fast path proposed here, expose the underlying results. Apply color effects that can't be expressed in CSS.
[10:30] <Sayna_> Travis: question, do we have Mike's parallel explainer here?
[10:30] <Sayna_> Sushanth: no it is not.
[10:32] <Sayna_> Travis: second question for Mike, you start with raw input (or even what Travis has already), you want an in-between state where browser has done some work in shaping, positioning, kerning, and the unit that you are imagining is like ?

[10:34] * Travis thank you!
[10:34] <yjbanov> The above are the Skia proposals/explainers for a text shaping API
[10:37] <Sayna_> https://github.com/google/skia/blob/main/site/docs/dev/design/text_shaper.md
[10:44] <@Travis> fernando: I'm wondering if all the detail shown in that spec is actually necessary.
[10:44] <@Travis> (discussion of fonts and potential privacy concerns)
[10:44] <Sayna_> koji: when input is given, open text spec produces a set of data which can be used to measure before css renders line breaking and layout. Shaping is quite heavy, it's often 20-80 % of layout total time.
[10:45] <Sayna_> Mike: this is why I want the browser to do shaping.
[10:45] <@Travis> So avoiding multiple shaping passes sounds like an ideal design.
[10:48] <@Travis> fernando: may be a way to satisfy the use case without needing to get into the details of fonts and their insides...
[10:49] <@Travis> .. would like to avoid creating a font object
[10:50] <@Travis> noamh: https://github.com/foliojs/fontkit
[10:52] <@Travis> yjbanov: script has to do so much today: pull down harfbuzz, ICU data, font-parsing logic... so much!
[10:52] <@Travis> .. would love to get the 80% done.
[10:52] <@Travis> fernando: if you can avoid the font-file parsing, the spec becomes easier.
[10:53] <@Travis> .. we can't have an API that just exposes glyph ids (and nothing else)
[10:54] <@Travis> mike: have another part of the proposal that takes glyph ids, and draws the text from those glyphs.
[10:55] <@Travis> fernando: would love to remove the need to parse the font. If we can do this, this would be better for users.
[10:55] <@Travis> yjbanov: just having a hard time imagining how to do this with glyph ids.
[10:56] <@Travis> sushanth: in WebGL, server offers an SDF where the glyph ids are useful...
[10:57] <@Travis> SDF / signed distance field
[10:58] <@Travis> fernando: there are scenarios where you have external information about glyph ids that don't require going through a font.
[10:59] <@Travis> sushanth: it was more expensive to get all the metrics out of the canvas formatted text...
[10:59] <@Travis> mike: yes, make it optional to pull the metrics out.
[11:00] <@Travis> sushanth: there was also complexity in exposing line objects (for rendering). Have to worry about caching, etc.
[11:00] <@Travis> .. our idea is to have a measureFormattedText to then pull out the metrics.
[11:01] <@Travis> mike: if the proposal can export the raw data, that's ideal.
[11:01] <@Travis> fernando: having a styleMap makes impl in workers impossible...
[11:01] <@Travis> Sushanth: I think I can make it work (will re-work the change)
[11:02] <@Travis> fernando: today you use .style
[11:02] <@Travis> fernando: proposal relies heavily on CSS parsing...
[11:03] <@Travis> .. most common way to express style is .style object
[11:06] <@Travis> .. may be a reason to do it the styleMap (from CSSWG)
[11:07] <@Travis> .. styleMap doesn't necessarily help the user know if a property is supported.
[11:14] <koji> Correction to my words: I meant "OpenType spec" instead of "open text spec". Great if you can fix it in the minutes.
[11:15] <@Travis> Will do.
